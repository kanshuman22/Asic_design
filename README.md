# ASIC DESIGN  

## TASK 1

### C Code 
A code to print sum of numbers from 1 to n(100)

Code:

### RISC-V compilation

* Compilation with flag set as O1:

*  Object file creation shown below:

* Execution of the program and corresponding output:

* We will now focus on the main section . We want to calculate the total no. of instructions. To do this we will subtract the address of the first instruction in the main section from the first instruction in the next section. As it is a byte addressable memory so we will divide by 4 to get the no. of instructions.
Here the first instruction address for main is 10184 and the first instruction in the next section is 101c0 (Hexadecimal) . The difference is 60. So the no. of instructions is 60/4=15.

*Compiling with flag set as Ofast

### Conclusion

It is observed that the no. of instructions reduces to 12 for Ofast from 15 for O1
Ofast reduces  set of instructions  as Ofast applies aggressive optimizations that  removes redundancies and uses parallelism .So the instructions are less when we compare to O1 case.


## TASK 2

Using Ofast 

* Compiling the objdump file:

### Debugging using SPIKE

Command used 

```bash
spike -d pk sum1ton.o
```

* We'll let Spike run the program until it reaches a specific point,which is the start of the main part of the program (marked by the instruction "100b0").

Once we get there, we'll observe the "a0 register". We'll check its value before and after a specific command runs.
We can observe that the instruction "lui a0,Ox21" changes the value of the register "a0" from  0x0000000000000001 to 0x0000000000021000

* Debugging the next instruction - "addi sp,sp,-16". The stack pointer (sp) is decremented by 16.
* We can observe that before execution of this instruction , sp register value was 0x0000003ffffffb50 , it gets updated to 0x0000003ffffffb40.
